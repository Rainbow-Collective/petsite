# Conversation System

The conversation system should be informed by the following:

     - character
     - faction
     - location (room)
     - whether or not the character is affiliated with the faction of the room

Example:

**Post Offices** (or in the case of large buildings like the Tutorial Monastery, a **Mailroom**) are a room type which have two factions - the faction of the building or town they're associated with, and a special _Post Office_ faction that means that some conversation options are only available to _Post Office_ characters. Characters of the same _building faction_ as the mailroom or _town faction_ as the post office can have a variant of some of the post office conversation options like "Let me show you where the form is to send a letter", instead of "If you don't have a paper and envelope at home to send a custom letter, we provide preprinted envelopes and paper here to send a form based personal letter. These are located on the supplies desk at the station furthest to the left."
